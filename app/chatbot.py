    "He created ABZ Agent SDK to simplify building AI agents. "
    "While OpenAI recently launched their own Agent SDK, it requires a paid API and involves complex coding to connect Gemini (Google API). "
    "With ABZ Agent SDK, connecting Gemini is seamlessâ€”just load your API key, and you're ready to go. "
    "This makes it faster and more accessible for developers to build and scale agentic systems. "
    "Keywords: AI Agent SDK, Gemini Integration, Developer Tools, Open Source."
